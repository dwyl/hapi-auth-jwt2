This node.js module (Hapi plugin) lets you use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
for authentication in your [Hapi.js](https://hapi.dev/)
web application.

If you are totally new to JWTs, we wrote an introductory post explaining
the concepts & benefits: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens

If you (or anyone on your team) are unfamiliar with **Hapi.js** we have a
quick guide for that too: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-hapi

Other language documents:

- [中文文档](./README-zh_CN.md)
## Usage

We tried to make this plugin as user (developer) friendly as possible,
but if anything is unclear, please submit any questions as issues on GitHub:
https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues

### Install from NPM

```sh
npm install hapi-auth-jwt2 --save
```

### Example

This basic usage example should help you get started:


```javascript
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');

const people = { // our "users database"
    1: {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Jen Jones'
    }
};

// bring your own validation function
const validate = async function (decoded, request, h) {

    // do your checks to see if the person is valid
    if (!people[decoded.id]) {
      return { isValid: false };
    }
    else {
      return { isValid: true };
    }
};

const init = async () => {
  const server = new Hapi.server({ port: 8000 });
  // include our module here ↓↓, for example, require('hapi-auth-jwt2')
  await server.register(require('../lib'));
  server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt',
  { key: 'NeverShareYourSecret', // Never Share your secret key
    validate  // validate function defined above
  });

  server.auth.default('jwt');

  server.route([
    {
      method: "GET", path: "/", config: { auth: false },
      handler: function(request, h) {
        return {text: 'Token not required'};
      }
    },
    {
      method: 'GET', path: '/restricted', config: { auth: 'jwt' },
      handler: function(request, h) {
        const response = h.response({text: 'You used a Token!'});
        response.header("Authorization", request.headers.authorization);
        return response;
      }
    }
  ]);
  await server.start();
  return server;
}
init().then(server => {
  console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri);
})
.catch(err => {
  console.log(err);
});

```

## *Quick Demo*

Open your terminal and clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2.git && cd hapi-auth-jwt2
```

Run the server with:

```sh
npm install && node example/server.js
```

Now (*in a different terminal window*) use `cURL` to access the two routes:

#### No Token Required

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:8000/
```



#### Token Required

Try to access the /*restricted* content *without* supplying a Token
(*expect* to see a ***401 error***):
```sh
curl -v http://localhost:8000/restricted
```
or visit: http://localhost:8000/restricted in your web browser.
(*both requests will be blocked and return a `401 Unauthorized` error*)


Now access the url using the following format:
`curl -H "Authorization: <TOKEN>" http://localhost:8000/restricted`

A here's a *valid* token you can use (*copy-paste* this command):
```sh
curl -v -H "Authorization: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwibmFtZSI6IkFudGhvbnkgVmFsaWQgVXNlciIsImlhdCI6MTQyNTQ3MzUzNX0.KA68l60mjiC8EXaC2odnjFwdIDxE__iDu5RwLdN1F2A" \
http://localhost:8000/restricted
```

or visit this url in your browser (*passing the token in url*):

<small> http://localhost:8000/restricted?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwibmFtZSI6IkFudGhvbnkgVmFsaWQgVXNlciIsImlhdCI6MTQyNTQ3MzUzNX0.KA68l60mjiC8EXaC2odnjFwdIDxE__iDu5RwLdN1F2A </small>

That's it.

Now write your own `validate` with what ever checks you want to perform
on the **decoded** token before allowing the visitor to proceed.

## Documentation

- `key` - (***required*** - *unless you have a `customVerify` function*) the secret key (or array of potential keys)
used to check the signature of the token ***or*** a **key lookup function** with
signature `async function(decoded)` where:
    - `decoded` - the ***decoded*** but ***unverified*** JWT received from client
    - Returns an object `{ key, extraInfo }` where:
        - `key` - the secret key (or array of keys to try)
        - `extraInfo` - (***optional***) any additional information that you would like to use in `validate` which can be accessed
        via `request.plugins['hapi-auth-jwt2'].extraInfo`
    - Throws a Boom error when key lookup fails.  Refer to [this example implementation](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/blob/main/test/dynamic_key_server.js)
    and [its associated test](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/blob/main/test/dynamic_key.test.js) for a working example.
- `validate` - (***required***) the function which is run once the Token has been decoded with
 signature `async function(decoded, request, h)` where:
    - `decoded` - (***required***) is the decoded and verified JWT received in the request
    - `request` - (***required***) is the original ***request*** received from the client
    - `h` - (***required***) the response toolkit.
    - Returns an object `{ isValid, credentials, response }` where:
        - `isValid` - `true` if the JWT was valid, otherwise `false`.
        - `credentials` - (***optional***) alternative credentials to be set instead of `decoded`.
        - `response` - (***optional***) If provided will be used immediately as a takeover response.
        - `errorMessage` - (***optional*** *defaults to* `'Invalid credentials'`) - the error message raised to Boom if the token is invalid (passed to `errorFunc` as `errorContext.message`)

### *Optional* Parameters

- `verifyOptions` - (***optional*** *defaults to none*) settings to define how tokens are verified by the
[jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback) library
    - `ignoreExpiration` - ignore expired tokens
    - `audience` - do not enforce token [*audience*](https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#audDef)
    - `issuer` - do not require the issuer to be valid
    - `algorithms` - list of allowed algorithms
- `responseFunc` - (***optional***) function called to decorate the response with authentication headers before the response headers or payload is written where:
    - `request` - the request object.
    - `h`- the response toolkit.
- `errorFunc` - (***optional*** *defaults to raising the error requested*) function called when an error has been raised. It provides an extension point to allow the host the ability to customise the error messages returned. Passed in object follows the following schema:
    - `errorContext` - the error object.
      - `errorContext.errorType` - ***required*** the `Boom` method to call (eg. unauthorized)
      - `errorContext.message` - ***required*** the `message` passed into the `Boom` method call
      - `errorContext.schema` - the `schema` passed into the `Boom` method call
      - `errorContext.attributes` - the `attributes` passed into the `Boom` method call
      - The function is expected to return the modified `errorContext` with all above fields defined.
    - `request` - the request object.
    - `h`- the response toolkit.
- `urlKey` - (***optional***  *defaults to* `'token'`) - if you prefer to pass your token via url, simply add a `token` url parameter to your request or use a custom parameter by setting `urlKey`. To disable the url parameter set urlKey to `false` or ''.
- `cookieKey` - (***optional*** *defaults to* `'token'`) - if you prefer to set your own cookie key or your project has a cookie called `'token'` for another purpose, you can set a custom key for your cookie by setting `options.cookieKey='yourkeyhere'`. To disable cookies set cookieKey to `false` or ''.
- `headerKey` - (***optional***  *defaults to* `'authorization'`) - The lowercase name of an HTTP header to read the token from. To disable reading the token from a header, set this to `false` or ''.
- `payloadKey` - (***optional***  *defaults to* `'token'`) - The lowercase name of an HTTP POST body to read the token from. To disable reading the token from a payload, set this to `false` or ''. Please note, this will not prevent authentication falling through to the `payload` method unless `attemptToExtractTokenInPayload` is false
- `tokenType` - (***optional*** *defaults to none*) - allow custom token type, e.g. `Authorization: <tokenType> 12345678`.
- `complete` - (***optional*** *defaults to* `false`) - set to `true` to receive the complete token (`decoded.header`, `decoded.payload` and `decoded.signature`) as `decoded` argument to key lookup and `verify` callbacks (*not `validate`*)
- `headless` - (***optional*** *defaults to none*) - set to an `object` containing the header part of the JWT token that should be added to a headless JWT token received. Token's with headers can still be used with this option activated. e.g `{ alg: 'HS256', typ: 'JWT' }`
- `attemptToExtractTokenInPayload` - (***optional*** *defaults to* `false`) - set to `true` to let the `authenticate` method fall through to the `payload` method for token extraction
- `customExtractionFunc` - (***optional***) function called to perform a custom extraction of the JWT where:
    - `request` - the request object.

### Useful Features

- The *encoded* JWT (token) is extracted from the request and
made available on the `request` object as `request.auth.token`,
in case you need it later on in the request lifecycle.
This feature was requested by @mcortesi in
[hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/123](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/123)


### Understanding the Request Flow

At the simplest level this is the request flow through a Hapi App
using `hapi-auth-jwt2`:

![hapi auth request flow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/443149/11938155/a5fa9554-a7cd-11e5-92b1-01efd6841ded.png)

### verifyOptions let you define how to Verify the Tokens (*Optional*)

example:
```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', true,
{ key: 'NeverShareYourSecret', // Never Share your secret key
  validate: validate,      // validate function defined above
  verifyOptions: {
    ignoreExpiration: true,    // do not reject expired tokens
    algorithms: [ 'HS256' ]    // specify your secure algorithm
  }
});
```

Read more about this at: [jsonwebtoken verify options]( https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback)

### Specify Signing Algorithm (*Optional but highly recommended*)

For [security reasons](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/) it is recommended that you specify the allowed algorithms used when signing the tokens:
```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', true,
{ key: 'YourSuperLongKeyHere', // Never Share your secret key
  validate: validate,      // validate function defined above
  verifyOptions: { algorithms: [ 'HS256' ] }  // only allow HS256 algorithm
});
```

If you prefer *not* to use any of these verifyOptions simply
do not set them when registering the plugin with your app;
they are all optional.

This feature was requested in: [issues/29](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/29)

### Using Base64 encoded secret keys

Some authentication services (like Auth0) provide secret keys encoded in base64, To find out if your authentication service is one of these services, please try and experiment with the base64 encoded secret options on the validator at https://jwt.io

If your key is base64 encoded, then for `JWT2` to use it you need to convert it to a `Buffer`.  Following is an example of how to do this.

```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', true,
{ key: Buffer.from('<Your Base64 encoded secret key>', 'base64'), // Never Share your secret key
  validate: validate,      // validate function defined above
  verifyOptions: { algorithms: [ 'HS256' ] }  // only allow HS256 algorithm
});
```

### Authentication Modes

This plugin supports [authentication modes](https://hapi.dev/api/#route-options) on routes.

- `required` - requires JWT to be sent with every request

- `optional` - if no JWT is provided, request will pass with `request.auth.isAuthenticated` set to `false` and `request.auth.credentials` set to null

- `try` - similar to `optional`, but invalid JWT will pass with `request.auth.isAuthenticated` set to `false` and failed credentials provided in `request.auth.credentials`

### Additional notes on keys and key lookup functions

- This option to look up a secret key was added to support "multi-tenant" environments. One use case would be companies that white label API services for their customers and cannot use a shared secret key. If the key lookup function needs to use fields from the token header (e.g. [x5t header](https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token-01.html#ReservedHeaderParameterName)), set option `completeToken` to `true`.

- The reason why you might want to pass back `extraInfo` in the callback is because you likely need to do a database call to get the key which also probably returns useful user data. This could save you another call in `validate`.

- The key or value returned by the key lookup function can also be an array of keys to try.  Keys will be tried until one of them successfully verifies the signature. The request will only be unauthorized if ALL of the keys fail to verify. This is useful if you want to support multiple valid keys (like continuing to accept a deprecated key while a client switches to a new key).

```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', true,
{ key: [ 'PrimareSecretKey', 'DeprecatedKeyStillAcceptableForNow' ],
  validate: validate,
  verifyOptions: { algorithms: [ 'HS256' ] }
});
```

## URL (URI) Token

Several people requested the ability pass in JSNOWebTokens in the requested URL:
[dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/**19**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/19)

### Usage

Setup your hapi.js server as described above (*no special setup for using JWT tokens in urls*)

```sh
https://yoursite.co/path?token=your.jsonwebtoken.here
```
You will need to generate/supply a valid tokens for this to work.

```js
const JWT   = require('jsonwebtoken');
const obj   = { id:123,"name":"Charlie" }; // object/info you want to sign
const token = JWT.sign(obj, secret);
const url   = "/path?token="+token;
```

> What if I want to *disable* the ability to pass JWTs in via the URL?
> Set your `urlKey` to `false` or ''. (*added by* @bitcloud: [issue #146](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/pull/146))

## Generating Your Secret Key

@skota asked "***How to generate secret key***?" in: [dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/**48**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/48)

There are *several* options for generating secret keys.
The *easiest* way is to run Node's `crypto` hash in your terminal:
```js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```
and copy the resulting base64 key and use it as your JWT secret.


## Want to access the JWT token *after* validation?

[@mcortesi](https://github.com/mcortesi) requested the ability to
access the (*raw*) JWT token used for authentication.
[dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/**123**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/123)

You can access the extracted JWT token in your handler or any other function
within the request lifecycle with the `request.auth.token` property.

*Note* that this is the ***encoded token***,
and it's only useful if you want to use to make
request to other servers using the user's token.

The *decoded* version of the token, accessible via `request.auth.credentials`

## Want to send/store your JWT in a Cookie?

[@benjaminlees](https://github.com/benjaminlees)
requested the ability to send/receive tokens as cookies:
[dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/**55**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/55)
So we added the ability to *optionally* send/store your tokens in cookies
to simplify building your *web app*.

To enable cookie support in your application all you need to do is add
a few lines to your code:

### Cookie Options

Firstly set the options you want to apply to your cookie:

```js
const cookie_options = {
  ttl: 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // expires a year from today
  encoding: 'none',    // we already used JWT to encode
  isSecure: true,      // warm & fuzzy feelings
  isHttpOnly: true,    // prevent client alteration
  clearInvalid: false, // remove invalid cookies
  strictHeader: true   // don't allow violations of RFC 6265
}
```

### Set the Cookie on your `reply`

Then, in your authorisation handler

```js
reply({text: 'You have been authenticated!'})
.header("Authorization", token)        // where token is the JWT
.state("token", token, cookie_options) // set the cookie with options
```

For a *detailed* example please see:
[https://github.com/nelsonic/hapi-auth-jwt2-cookie-example](https://github.com/nelsonic/hapi-auth-jwt2-cookie-example)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Do I *need* to include `jsonwebtoken` in my project?

**Q**: Must I include the **jsonwebtoken** package in my project
[given that **hapi-auth-jwt2** plugin already includes it] ? asked in 
[hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/32](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/32)  
**A**: Yes, you need to *manually* install the **jsonwebtoken**
node module from NPM with `npm install jsonwebtoken --save` if you want to ***sign*** JWTs in your app.
Even though **hapi-auth-jwt2** includes it
as a **dependency** your app does not know where to find it in the **node_modules** tree for your project.
Unless you include it via ***relative path*** e.g:
`const JWT = require('./node_modules/hapi-auth-jwt2/node_modules/jsonwebtoken');`
we *recommend* including it in your **package.json** ***explicitly*** as a **dependency** for your project.

### ***Custom Verification*** ?

Can we supply a ***Custom Verification*** function instead of using the **JWT.verify** method?  
asked by *both* [Marcus Stong](https://github.com/stongo) & [Kevin Stewart](https://github.com/kdstew)
in [issue #120](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/120) and [issue #130](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/130) respectively.
**Q**: Does this module support custom verification function or disabling verification?
**A**: Yes, it *does now*! (*see: "Advanced Usage" below*) the inclusion of a `verify`
gives you *complete control* over the verification of the incoming JWT.

<br />

### Can I use `hapi-auth-jwt2` with [`glue`](https://github.com/hapijs/glue)

Several people asked us if this plugin is compatible with
Hapi's "Server Composer" [`glue`](https://github.com/hapijs/glue)

The answer is ***Yes***! For an example of how to do this,
see [@avanslaars](https://github.com/avanslaars) code example:
[https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/151#issuecomment-218321212](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/151#issuecomment-218321212)

<br />

### How do I *invalidate* an *existing token*?

Asked by [@SanderElias](https://github.com/SanderElias) in [hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/126](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/126)

We store our JWT-based sessions in a Redis datastore and lookup the session (`jti`) for the given JWT during the `validate` (*validation function*) see: 
[https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2-example/blob/791b0d3906d4deb256daf23fcf8f5021905abe9e/index.js#L25](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2-example/blob/791b0d3906d4deb256daf23fcf8f5021905abe9e/index.js#L25)
This means we can invalidate the session in Redis and then reject a request that uses an "old" or invalid JWT. see:
[https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2-example/blob/791b0d3906d4deb256daf23fcf8f5021905abe9e/index.js#L25](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2-example/blob/791b0d3906d4deb256daf23fcf8f5021905abe9e/index.js#L25)


<br />

### How do I set JWT Auth to *All Routes*?

[@abeninskibede](https://github.com/abeninskibede) asked how to set all routes to use JWT Auth in [hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/149](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/149)

We tend to enable `hapi-auth-jwt2` for *all* routes by setting the default strategy to 'jwt' (so its `required` for all endpoints) because *most* of the endpoints in our app require the person/user to be authenticated e.g:

```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', {
  ...
});
server.auth.default('jwt'); // so JWT auth is required for all routes
```

When you want a particular route to ***not require*** JWT auth you simply set `config: { auth: false }` e.g:
```js
server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/login',
  handler: login_handler,  // display login/registration form/page
  options: { auth: false } // don't require people to be logged in to see the login page! (duh!)
});
```


<br />
The best place to *understand* everything about Hapi Auth is in the docs: 
[https://hapi.dev/tutorials/auth/#default](https://hapi.dev/tutorials/auth/#default)
But if you have any questions which are not answered there, feel free to 
[ask!](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues)

### How to *redirect* if a token has expired?

@traducer & @goncalvesr2 both requested how to redirect after failed Auth in
[hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/161](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/161)
and [hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/148](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/148) respectively

The [`hapi-error`](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-error) lets
you *easily* redirect to any url you define if the Auth check fails
(i.e. `statusCode 401`)
see:
[https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-error#redirectredirecting-to-another-endpoint](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-error#redirectredirecting-to-another-endpoint)
(*code examples there.*)

<br />

### How do I change my token and re-state it without becoming unauthenticated? ###

For example:

If the `request.auth.credentials` object initially added to your `/` endpoint initial  was:

``` js
{
  userId: 1,
  permission: 'ADMIN'
}
```

And you want to change the user's permission to `SUPER_ADMIN`.

Retrieve the initial session object added as a token to `/`  
```js
const session  = request.auth.credentials;
```
Change the object
```js
session.permission = 'SUPER_ADMIN';
```
Sign as a JWT token again
```js
const token = JWT.sign(session, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
```
Reply as usual whilst re-adding the token to your original endpoint `/`
```js
reply().state('token', token, { path: '/' }).redirect('/wherever');
```

## *How do I support users with JS disabled*

An issue can arise when supporting users with JavaScript disabled when JWTs are too large to pass on query strings.

With JS disabled, tokens cannot be added to headers by using redirects from OAuth providers in to the consuming service.

Cloud providers will place limitations on URI lengths

OAuth services may not always sit on a sibling subdomain of the protected service negating the use of a secure cookie

The only way to pass a token in this case is to use either an HTML form with the token in a hidden field and a button with instructions for users to press the button if they have JS disabled and some JS that will submit the form automatically if it is enabled

To configure `hapi-auth-jwt` to support this scenario, you will need to adapt the following sample configuration
```js
server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', {
  key: 'NeverShareYourSecret',
  // defining our own validate function lets us do something
  // useful/custom with the decodedToken before reply(ing)
  validate: (decoded, request) => true,
  verifyOptions: { algorithms: [ 'HS256' ] }, // only allow HS256 algorithm
  attemptToExtractTokenInPayload: true,
  // using yar as a session cache to store tokens, see: https://github.com/hapijs/yar
  customExtractionFunc: request => {
    if (request.auth && request.auth.token) {
      request.yar.set('token', request.auth.token)
      return request.auth.token;
    }
    const token = request.yar.get('token');
    if (token) {
      return token;
    }
  }
});
```

The configuration above will still run the normal token extraction attempts for headers, cookies, query string parameters and custom extraction. However, if there is no token successfully extracted, it will attempt to extract one from POST request bodies

As the authentication phase of a HAPI request will apply scope protection
before POST bodies are parsed, you will need to also define the route on
which you will handle JWTs with no scope applied or the POST requests with
JWT payloads will fail when you globally apply scope as part of your
application

```js
server.route([
      {
        method: 'POST',
        path: '/',
        handler: (request, response) => response.redirect('/home'),
        config: {
            auth: {
              strategies: ['jwt'],
              payload: 'required'
            }
          }
        }
      ]);
```

This route will, when a JWT is posted failover from the authentication phase to the payload authentication phase, extract a JWT, store it in the YAR session cache and redirect the user to the `/home` path using a standard 302 response. When the handler for `/home` is JWT protected, the `customExtractionFunc` defined in the auth strategy will read the JWT from the users session cache and use it for authentication

## *Advanced/Alternative* Usage => Bring Your Own `verify`

While *most* people using `hapi-auth-jwt2` will opt for the *simpler* use case
(*using a* ***Validation Function*** *`validate` - see: Basic Usage example above - which validates the JWT payload after it has been verified...*)
others may need more control over the `verify` step.

The [*internals*](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/blob/eb9fff9fc384fde07ec2a1d2f0da520be902da2c/l˜/index.js#L58)
of `hapi-auth-jwt2` use the `jsonwebtoken.verify` method to ***verify*** if the
JWT was signed using the `JWT_SECRET` (*secret key*).

If you prefer specifying your own verification logic instead of having a `validate`, simply define a `verify` instead when initializing the plugin.

- `verify` - (***optional***) the function which is run once the Token has been decoded
(*instead of a `validate`*) with signature `async function(decoded, request)` where:
    - `decoded` - (***required***) is the decoded but ***unverified*** JWT received in the request.
    - `request` - (***required***) is the original ***request*** received from the client
    - Returns an object `{ isValid, credentials }` where:
        - `isValid` - `true` if the JWT was valid, otherwise `false`.
        - `credentials` - (***optional***) alternative credentials to be set instead of `decoded`.

The advantage of this approach is that it allows people to write a
custom verification function or to bypass the `JWT.verify` *completely*.
For more detail, see: use-case discussion in 
[https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/120](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/120)


> ***Note***: *nobody has requested the ability to use* ***both*** *a*
`validate` ***and*** `verify`.
This should not be *necessary*
because with a `verify` you can incorporate your own custom-logic.

### Compatibility

**`hapi-auth-jwt2`** version **`10.x.x`** is an ***optional upgrade***
that includes a ***breaking change***.
Several users of the plugin requested that the `artifacts`
returned on successful authentication be an `Object` instead of a `String`.
Sadly this is a breaking change, hence the new major release.


**`hapi-auth-jwt2`** version **`9.x.x`** is compatible with **Hapi.js `19.x.x`**
which only supports **Node.js 12+**.
While **`hapi-auth-jwt2`** version `9.0.0`
does not have *any* code changes from `v8.8.1`
(*so there should not be any need to update your code that uses this plugin*),
we felt it was prudent to make it clear to people that Hapi.js
(*the core framework*) has
[dropped support for Node.js 10](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/338#issuecomment-583716612)
and people should treat *this* package
as no longer supporting the older versions of Node. <br />

`hapi-auth-jwt2` version `8.x.x`
is compatible with Hapi.js version `17.x.x` - `19.x.x` <br />

`hapi-auth-jwt2` version `7.x.x` is compatible with `16.x.x`
`15.x.x` `14.x.x` `13.x.x` `12.x.x` `11.x.x` `10.x.x` `9.x.x` and `8.x.x`
Hapi `17.x.x` is a *major* rewrite that's why version `8.x.x`
of the plugin is not backward compatible!

However in the interest of
 security/performance we *recommend* using the [*latest version*](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/) of Hapi.

### Production-ready Examples?

#### Using PostgreSQL?

See: https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-login-example-postgres

#### Using Redis

Redis is *perfect* for storing session data that needs to be checked
on every authenticated request.

If you are unfamiliar with Redis or anyone on your team needs a refresher,
please checkout: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redis

The ***code*** is at: https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2-example
and with tests. please ask additional questions if unclear!

Having a more real-world example was *seconded* by [@manonthemat](https://github.com/manonthemat) see:
[hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/9](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/9)

### Real World Example ?

If you would like to see a "***real world example***" of this plugin in use
in a ***production*** web app (API)
please see: https://github.com/dwyl/time/tree/main/api/lib

- **app.js** ***registering*** the **hapi-auth-jwt2 plugin**:
[app.js#L13](https://github.com/dwyl/time/blob/0a5ec8711840528a4960c388825fb883fabddd76/app.js#L13)

- telling app.js where to find our **validate** Function:
[app.js#L21](https://github.com/dwyl/time/blob/0a5ec8711840528a4960c388825fb883fabddd76/app.js#L21)

- **validate** Function (how we check the JWT is still valid):
[api/lib/auth_jwt_validate.js](https://github.com/dwyl/time/blob/0a5ec8711840528a4960c388825fb883fabddd76/api/lib/auth_jwt_validate.js) looks up the person's session in our ElasticSearch Database
if the [session record is ***found*** (valid) and ***not ended***](https://github.com/dwyl/time/blob/0a5ec8711840528a4960c388825fb883fabddd76/api/lib/auth_jwt_validate.js#L12) we allow the person to see the restricted content.

- **Signing your JWTs**: in your app you need a method to *sign* the JWTs (and put them in a database
  if that's how you are *verifying* your sessions) ours is:
  [api/lib/auth_jwt_sign.js](https://github.com/dwyl/time/blob/0a5ec8711840528a4960c388825fb883fabddd76/api/lib/auth_jwt_sign.js#L18)

## Motivation

While making [***Time***](https://github.com/dwyl/time) we want to ensure
our app (and API) is as ***simple*** as *possible* to use.
This lead us to using JSON Web Tokens for ***Stateless*** Authentication.

We did a *extensive* [research](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=hapi+auth+jwt)
into *existing* modules that *might* solve our problem; there are *many* on NPM:
![npm search for hapi+jwt](https://i.imgur.com/xIj3Xpa.png)

but they were invariably ***too complicated***, poorly documented and
had *useless* (non-real-world) "examples"!

Also, none of the *existing* modules exposed the **request** object
to the **validate** which we thought might be handy.

So we decided to write our own module addressing all these issues.

*Don't take our word for it, do your own homework and decide which module you prefer.*


## Why hapi-auth-jwt2 ?

The name we wanted was taken.
Think of our module as the "***new, simplified and actively maintained version***"
